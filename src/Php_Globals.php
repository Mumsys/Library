/**
 * Nice interface for php's GLOBAL VARIABLES.
 *
 * @deprecated since version 1.0.0 Use \Mumsys_Php_Globals
 *
 * Wraper for $GLOBALS, $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION,
 * $_REQUEST and $_ENV and getenv().
 *
 * When ever using the server or env variables and your are bored about testing
 * if an array key exists and/or has a value you may find this class useful to
 * always have a default value if something NOT EXISTS. eg.: When switching to
 * shell, something is not available. This will solve some or more overhead
 * implementing things but brings more memory usage.
 * If you dont really need some of the methodes: don't use them! As long the
 * initialisation of the super globals is not needed you are in a good
 * performace way. With or without this class.
