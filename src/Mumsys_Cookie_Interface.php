     * $_COOKIE['cookiename']
     * @param integer $expire unix timestamp the cookie will expire

     * available on. If set to '/', the cookie will be available within the
     * entire domain. If set to '/foo/', the cookie will only be available within
     * the /foo/ directory and all sub-directories such as /foo/bar/ of domain.
     * The default value is the current directory that the cookie is being set in.
     * @param string $domain The (sub)domain that the cookie is available to.
     * Setting this to a subdomain (such as 'www.example.com') will make the cookie
     * available to that subdomain and all other sub-domains of it (i.e.
     * w2.www.example.com). To make the cookie available to the whole domain
     * (including all subdomains of it), simply set the value to the domain
     * name ('example.com', in this case).

     * over a secure HTTPS connection from the client. When set to TRUE, the

     * it's on the programmer to send this kind of cookie only on secure connection
     * (e.g. with respect to $_SERVER["HTTPS"]).
     * @param boolean $httponly When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only
     * through the HTTP protocol. This means that the cookie won't be accessible by
     * scripting languages, such as JavaScript. It has been suggested that this
