     * Serialize a value using php serialize() function.
     *
     * @param mixed $value The value to be serialized. serialize() handles all
     * types, except the resource-type and some objects (see note below). You
     * can even serialize() arrays that contain references to itself. Circular
     * references inside the array/object you are serializing will also be
     * stored. Any other reference will be lost.
     * When serializing objects, PHP will attempt to call the member function
     * __sleep() prior to serialization. This is to allow the object to do any
     * last minute clean-up, etc. prior to being serialized. Likewise, when the
     * object is restored using unserialize() the __wakeup() member function is
     * called.
     * Note:
     * Object's private members have the class name prepended to the member
     * name; protected members have a '*' prepended to the member name. These
     * prepended values have null bytes on either side.
     *
     * @return string Returns a string containing a byte-stream representation
     * of value that can be stored anywhere.
     * Note that this is a binary string which may include null bytes, and needs
     * to be stored and handled as such. For example, serialize() output should
     * generally be stored in a BLOB field in a database, rather than a CHAR or
     * TEXT field.

    /**
     * Unserialize a value using php unserialize() function if matches a php
     * serialize()'ed string.
     *
     * Do not pass untrusted user input to unserialize() regardless of the
     * options value of allowed_classes. Unserialization can result in code
     * being loaded and executed due to object instantiation and autoloading,
     * and a malicious user may be able to exploit this. Use a safe, standard
     * data interchange format such as JSON (via json_decode() and
     * json_encode()) if you need to pass serialized data to the user.
     *
     * If you need to unserialize externally-stored serialized data, consider
     * using hash_hmac() for data validation. Make sure data is not modified by
     * anyone but you.
     *
     * @param string $serializedValue Value from a php serialize() function: If
     * the variable being unserialized is an object, after successfully
     * reconstructing the object PHP will automatically attempt to call the
     * __wakeup() member function (if it exists).
     * Note: unserialize_callback_func directive
     * It's possible to set a callback-function which will be called, if an
     * undefined class should be instantiated during unserializing. (to prevent
     * getting an incomplete object "__PHP_Incomplete_Class".) Use your php.ini,
     * ini_set() or .htaccess to define unserialize_callback_func. Everytime an
     * undefined class should be instantiated, it'll be called. To disable this
     * feature just empty this setting.
     *
     * @param array $options Any options to be provided to unserialize(), as an
     * associative array.
     * Valid options Name Type Description allowed_classes mixed Either an array
     * of class names which should be accepted, FALSE to accept no classes, or
     * TRUE to accept all classes. If this option is defined and unserialize()
     * encounters an object of a class that isn't to be accepted, then the
     * object will be instantiated as __PHP_Incomplete_Class instead. Omitting
     * this option is the same as defining it as TRUE: PHP will attempt to
     * instantiate objects of any class.
     *
     * @return mixed|false Unserialized value. The converted value is returned,
     * and can be a boolean, integer, float, string, array or object.
     * In case the passed string is not unserializeable, --FALSE is returned and
     * E_NOTICE is issued.-- Exception will be thrown then!
