## History

In that time an admin CMS system to 
- create admin pages for new buissness tasks,
- huge lists of data 
- handling processes on the server side for audio and video tasks
- Shop related admin tasks and inventory control because then it was mostly used
  for a music distribution.

The library is a new part of the project. The MUMSYS library/ interface. 
A rework beginning in that time and now going to be free!

If you like it, use it, feel free to make it better. Commits should be done to 
the unstable branch.
