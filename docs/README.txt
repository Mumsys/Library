## History

In that time an admin CMS system to 
- create admin pages for new buissness tasks,
- huge lists of data 
- handling processes on the server side for audio and video tasks
- Shop related admin tasks and inventory control because then it was mostly used
    for a music distribution.

The library is a new part of the project. The MUMSYS library/ interface. 
A rework beginning in that time and now going to be free!

"MUMSYS 2 Library" is a project version: MUMSYS core parts going to a library, 
and it is/was version 2.
Now its going to be MUMSYS Library Version 3, The free version, and it will be
beginning with version 1

If you like it, use it, feel free to make it better. Commits should be done to 
the unstable branch.
