# MUMSYS - Library

Library for the MUMSYS project. Version 1 

MUMSYS stands for Multi User Managment System. Altn. "Mother System" (c) 2002 - 2021, now


In that time an admin CMS system to 
- create admin pages for new buissness tasks,
- huge lists of data 
- handling processes on the server side for audio and video tasks
- Shop related admin tasks and inventory control because then it was mostly used
  for a music distribution.

The library is a new part of the project. The MUMSYS library/ interface. 
A rework beginning in that time and now going to be free!
